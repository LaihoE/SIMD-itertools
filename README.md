#  SIMD-accelerated iterators

Change:
```Rust
arr.iter().min()
```
To:
```Rust
arr.iter().min_simd()
```


Currently the following are implemented:

```find```
```filter```
```position```
```contains```
```eq```
```min/max```
```is_sorted```
```all_equal```



### 🔥🚀 Performance gain compared to standard library 🚀🔥

Requires nightly for now 😔:
```Rust
rustup toolchain install nightly
rustup default nightly
// revert back to stable: rustup default stable
```
